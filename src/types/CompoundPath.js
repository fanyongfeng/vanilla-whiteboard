/**
 * @class A compound path is a complex path that is made up of one or more
 * simple sub-paths. It can have the `nonzero` fill rule, or the `evenodd` rule
 * applied. Both rules use mathematical equations to determine if any region is
 * outside or inside the final shape. The `evenodd` rule is more predictable:
 * Every other region within a such a compound path is a hole, regardless of
 * path direction.
